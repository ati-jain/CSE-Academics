Respected Sir,
The deadline for the 4th assignmentÂ was 12 pm. Due to our misunderstanding, we thought it to be 2pm as usual. When we came to know about the deadline, we just submitted whatever we have done till that time. That was also almost completed, except a few final things(formatting headers, etc.). However we have finalised it now. I am attaching the files with this mail.
We understand that the mistake is our since we didn't submit on time even after extension, but we request you to excuse us for this once and consider attched files as our submission.

Thanks and Regards,
Atishay Jain
