Shell scripts and functions are both interpreted. This means they are not compiled.
A variable is nothing more than a pointer to the actual data.
echo $0 will give the shell name.
echo $SHELL will give the current shell.
It is recommended to be careful with the spaces between braces and expression. No space produces a syntax error.
-e to use escape characters
-n to not put new line at end
