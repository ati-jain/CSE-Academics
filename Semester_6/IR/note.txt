Node Centrality: Relative importance of a node in a network

HITS - Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search, by Kleinberg
Authorities and Hub

h <- A.a
a <- A(transpose).h

Hubs often transit to authorities.

Iterative PageRank computation

Random surfer model

N x N transition probability matrix P.
PageRank scores obtained as the principal
left eigenvector of P

Biased PageRank: Teleport only to select nodes

Topic-sensitive PageRank: Run biased PageRank for relevant Topic

TrustRank: Biased towards trusted websites




differential semantics model: only calculates the difference/similarity in the semantic meaning of two words, not their actual meaning. Not referential.

target words: the words you want to find the context of
context words
distributional matrix: co-occurence matrix.
give some weightage, probability, tf-idf
reduce dimensionality, LSA, PLSA, PCA
Vector comparision, Euclidian, Cosine, Jaccard

one-hot encoding

word2vec encoding: each word is represented by a d-dimensional distribution vector, whose weights are learnt.
SVD: singular vector decomposition. kind of reduce dimensionality. top k rank
vetor addition: france + airline
