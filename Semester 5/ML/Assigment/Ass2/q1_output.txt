Size of dataset =4177

No. of attributes =8

Share in variance by each of the selected Principal Component axes is : [0.8255748  0.09384237 0.03491563]

We need atleast 3 principal components to preserve the variance by 95%

Applying K-means clustering with random initial centroids

No. of clusters for which Normalised Mutual Inforamtion(NMI) is maximum = 5
